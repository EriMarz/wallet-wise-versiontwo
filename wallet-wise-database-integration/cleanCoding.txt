Server.ts 
-adding a apiRouter to an api folder for modularization
-Why typescript error on server line 18?
-Wonder if some of this SQL logic should be in a controller file and imported in for modularization?

Create app.get for the api adventures to display all adventures
The info is not being pushed to the SQL database 


File organization:
server.ts being outside of the server folder is to be adjusted
Groups overview goes where? 
Groups overview folder was inside componetns folder, but vscode was grouping them together, because there were no files in components. After adding 'testing', 
    notes: we completely reorganized the file structure 

Could file structure look like:
 ✅client->/src
   ✅ -App.tsx
   ✅ -App.css
    ✅-components
       ✅ __tests__
        -functional components
            ✅ Button
            button testing (to create)
            ✅ Forms
        -layouts (presentational components)
            ✅List
            ✅ navbar
            ✅-header.tsx
            ✅-footer.tsx
            ✅-hero
    ✅-pages
        ✅__tests__
        ✅home pages
        ✅adventure details
        ✅create Adventure = 
        ✅groupTripDetails = adventureDetails
        ✅add expenses
        ✅*Login*
        ✅*Registration*
server
    ✅-controllers
        ✅adventureController
    ✅-models
    ✅-routes
        adventureRoutes
    ✅-tests
        adventure.test
    ✅-db connections/config
        ✅database.ts
   ✅ -server.ts
.env (?) ✅ that makes sense -esm  ty ~ <3

ROOT:
    ✅client
        src
    ✅server
    🚨.env
    ✅node_modules
    ✅gitignore
    ✅readMe
    ✅packagejson etc
        




Frontend 
CreateAdventure adjust to createAdventure
groupTripDetails adjust to groupAdventureDetails
modularize App.tsx by compartmentalizing FirstPage into its own component... homePage for cleaner code



🪲bugs🪲:
-use npm run dev -- --host to allow liveshare participants access to frontend server (guessing this would also work for backend if similar issue arrises)
-10k changes git status (tells us current status of things that are ready for our git commits) and echo "node_modules/" >> .gitignore (the echo double checks that all of our git ignore dependencies were being referenced)
-in restrucuturing our folders, we did not fix the imports for backend and frontend servers. This needed to be adjusted in the index.html file



~~~~ Kim's Notes in database.ts ~~~~~~~~~


//// We export an object that contains a property called query,
// which is a function that returns the invocation of pool.query() after logging the query
// This will be required in the controllers to be the access point to the database
// export default {
//   // Query function with TypeScript types:
//   // - text: SQL query string
//   // - params: Optional array of parameters for prepared statements
//   // - Returns: Promise that resolves to QueryResult (contains rows, rowCount, etc.)
//   query: (text: string, params?: any[]): Promise<QueryResult<any>> => {
//     // console.log("executed query", text);
//     return pool.query(text, params);
//   },
// };
